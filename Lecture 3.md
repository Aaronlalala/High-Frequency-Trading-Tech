**Virtual Environment**

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that mimics the operating system, allowing users to install software and dependencies isolated from the actual system.

Proxmox is an open-source server virtualization platform. It allow users to manage mutiple virtual machiens, containers, storage options and clustered setups through a web-based interface.

**Virtual Machines**

A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer, running an entire operating system, along with applications, on top of a ==hypervisor==. Hypervisor is a software that allows on host machine to support and manage multiple guest VMs.

VM provides strong isolation.

**Containers**

A container packages an application and its dependencies together but shares the OS kernel with other containers. It's more lightweight than a VM. 

Container provides process-level isolation.

**Docker**
